## User API with Flask

### Overview

This Flask application is designed to provide basic functionalities for managing user data through a RESTful API architecture. It includes endpoints for retrieving user information by ID and creating new users via POST requests. The API serves as a foundational component for applications requiring user management capabilities in a simple and efficient manner.

### Notes
